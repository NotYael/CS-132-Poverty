              And this is our project,
              <strong>Pan de Mic</strong>. In March 2020, in response to the
              COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippine government implemented lockdowns
              with varying stringency across the country, lasting for more than
              17 months, making it one of the longest lockdowns worldwide. These
              measures limited people's movement and affected many livelihoods.
              The year 2020 marked the country's deepest recession in post-war
              history. However, it is worth noting that the inflation rate
              during that time remained stable. Other factors affecting poverty
              such as employment, the state of the agriculture sector, and
              population growth, were also affected by the pandemic. This raises
              the question: how has the COVID-19 pandemic affected poverty in
              the Philippines? Additionally, we also want to know how this
              effect compares to other SEA countries. <br /><br />

                <strong>Null Hypothesis: </strong><br />There is no significant
                relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and increased poverty
                rates in the Philippines. <br /><br />
                <strong>Alternative Hypothesis: </strong><br />The COVID-19
                pandemic has a significant impact on increasing poverty rates in
                the Philippines due to factors such as the abrupt pause in
                employment, company downsizing, and the implementation of
                lockdown protocols, which disrupt income-generating
                opportunities for many households, leading to intensified
                economic burden on families.

              <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
              <p align="justify">
                Addressing the poverty rates in the Philippines is a tough task.
                We would first need to identify the factors that are affecting
                or have affected our poverty rates, particularly in the context
                of COVID, which is the primary focus of this project. To answer
                our research questions, we can analyze poverty trends in the
                Philippines before and after COVID. Next, we can apply a
                cross-country analysis/comparison with our data and the poverty
                rates of other Southeast Asian countries to assess how COVID has
                affected the Philippines compared to others.

          years: 2015, 2018, and 2021. For each of these years, data is provided

        <p><b>Hypothesis Testing</b></p>
        <p>
          We first checked if our data was normally distributed and had equal
          variance.
        </p>
        <div class="img.left">
          <img

          <p>
            For the Shapiro-Wilk Test, we found out that the 2015 data was
            normally distributed, however, the 2018 and 2021 data were not
            normally distributed.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          For the Levene Test, we found out that there was unequal variance
          accross the 2015, 2018, and 2021 data samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to this, non-parametric statistical tests are preferred. We
          performed the Mann-Whitney U-test for the 2018 and 2021 dataset, and
          the Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests for the entire dataset.

            The results showed that time is a significant factor in poverty
            rates, however, COVID-19 did not necessarily have a significant
            effect on poverty rates.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Further hypothesis tests could be done on this subject as there
            might not be enough time points to properly measure the impact of
            COVID-19 on poverty rates (e.g. There is no data for the years 2019
            and 2020, where majority of COVID-19 took place.)

              <h3>Discussion</h3>
              <p align="justify">
                 Our initial goal with this project was to determine if COVID-19 has any impact
                 on the poverty rates in the Philippines. To do so, we decided to check per region
                 and province. Through our analysis, we found that the results of statistical tests indicated a
                 significant influence. Therefore, this can suggest that the pandemic has disrupted economic 
                 activities and led to widespread job losses. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Other than performing statistical tests, we also trained a Machine Learning model that plots
                 the change in poverty incidence among the population. Positive values indicate an increase, 
                 and negative values indicate a decrease in poverty incidence. Let us look at how the behavior
                 of the two plots.
                 <br>
                 <ol>
                  <li>Regions
                    <ol>
                      <li>Cluster 0 (Red): These regions were able to control poverty rates.</li>
                      <li>Cluster 1 (Blue): These regions had varying results where some regions
                        improved poverty rates, but some got worse.
                      </li>
                      <li>Cluster 2 (Green): These regions were severely affected and showed increase
                        poverty rates
                      </li>
                    </ol> 
                  </li>
                  <li>Province
                    <ol>
                      <li>Cluster 0 (Red): These provinces were the least affected by COVID-19
                        and even showed a reduction in poverty levels.
                      </li>
                      <li>Cluster 1 (Blue): These provinces saw a moderate rise in poverty levels
                        caused by COVID-19.
                      </li>
                      <li>Cluster 2 (Green): These provinces saw a significant rise in poverty levels
                        cause by COVID-19.
                      </li>

              <h3>Conclusion</h3>
              <p align="justify">
                Based on our hypothesis testing, two out of the three statistical tests 
                conducted (Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests) reject the null hypothesis, 
                indicating statistically significant differences. These results provide 
                strong evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact 
                on increasing poverty rates in the Philippines. Additionally, the machine 
                learning model further corroborates these findings by showing distinct 
                clusters of regions and provinces, showcasing areas with varying 
                levels of impact on poverty incidence due to COVID-19.
